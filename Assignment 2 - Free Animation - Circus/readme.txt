All elements which have been successfully implemented:

- at least one texture was incorportated 

- a least one shader 

- connection to real-time 

- 360 degrees fly around camera which shows multiples angles of the animation 

- a movie of the animation in 512x512 and in a standard mp4 format

- a cover imge of 100x100 pixels 

-creativity as well as complexity was present for the project 

- background music that goes with the animation was also included 

- no references were used except the previous assignment//was all based off trial and error

- suffecient comments for easy to understand code 

- clean programming style

- time constraint was followed, the animation is about 56 seconds long 

Elements which were not implmented correctly: 

- displaying of frame rate in the console/graphics window (there was an attmept but couldnt figure it out completely)
